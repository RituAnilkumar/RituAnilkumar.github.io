Hi! My name is Ritu. I set up this blog to post about everything that I find super awesome. It is hopefully going to be a mix of how-to-dos and look-at-this-awesome-thing! While this entire blog is going to be the biggest About Me that is available, the TLDR is I love the hills, I like to travel with a small group of friends, I like literature, gardening, cooking and bouncing on the trampoline. I'm a doctoral student at the Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati. This is part time along with my regular job at the North Eastern Space Applications Centre in the gorgeous state of Meghalaya. More about living in Meghalaya, academics and life to follow. Meanwhile satisfy yourself with this gif of the Rainbow Falls near Nongriat village, Meghalaya.
